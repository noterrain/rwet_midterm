it was spinning the right way
It begs the question
it was spinning any faster
it looks like the final Earth rotates around 
it an angular speed of about 15.7 rad/s2
it will give me a more exact time difference
it depends on WHERE on the Earth you are
it is possible for humans to spin this fast
it is probably justified
it is moving in a circle
