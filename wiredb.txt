Is there a better person to have on a show for a science topic than Neil deGrasse Tyson?
 Yes?
 Maybe?
 That’s much bettern isn’t it?
 It begs the question: would people really fly off the Earth at this speed?
How Fast Does the Logo Spin?
 Why did Neil point out an error in the rotation speed but not an error in the Earth-in-Earth problem?
What would this feel like?
 Why?
What are fake forces?
what are real forces?
What about at other locations on the Earth?
 When you “fly off” the face of the Earth?
 If you spin the globe fastern would people fall off?
Where would people stop falling off the Earth?
 Why is the force from the ground not perpendicular to the ground?
 What do you see that is “odd”?
